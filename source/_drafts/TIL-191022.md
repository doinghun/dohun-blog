JavaScript

- Map
- Map vs Object:
- Key field: in Object, it follows the rule of normal dictionary. The keys MUST be simple types — either integer or string or symbols. Nothing more. But in Map it can be any data type (an object, an array, etc…).
- Element order: in Map, original order of elements (pairs) is preserved, while in Object, it isn’t.
- Inheritance: Map is an instance of Object (surprise surprise!), but Object is definitely not an instance of Map.
- How to construct
  - Object: direct literal | constructor | Object.prototype.create
  - Map: only 1 way - built-in constructor `new Map()`
