<!-- more -->

#### Data Structure & Algorithm: Bubble Sort

Steps involved:

1. Compare
2. Swap

   - ES5 vs ES2015

     ```javascript
     /* ES5 */
     var temp = arr[j]
     arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
     arr[j + 1] = temp

     /* ES2015 */
     ;[arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]]
     ```

3. Optimization
   - if already been swapped in inner loop, assign `noSwap` to `false`

#### JavaScript: Wth is ECMAScript?

- Initial Editions of ECMAScript are named numerically, increasing by 1: ES1, ES2, ES3, ES4, ES5.
- New editions (starting with 2015) will be named ES followed by the year of release: ES2015, ES2016, ES2017
- ECMAScript is a standard. JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard.
