Summary

- [DS & Algo : Missing Number](#DS-amp-Algo)
- [React : Redux - Insurance company analogy](#React)

<!-- more -->

#### DS & Algo

- Completed Missing Number which seemed like Array question but the question hinted that it could be done in linear runtime and constant space complexity - bit manipulation.
- Array solution involved array sort which slows down the efficiency and matching the number to the supposed number. Next best solution is summing up all integers in solution array and subtracting by integers in given array. Remainder is the integer missing - gaussian xxx
- Bit manipulation makes use of XOR which gives true output only if the input is odd. e.g. `1 ^ 0 = 1` , `0 ^ 1 = 1`
- But still confused about if the input is not binary, what would output be? solution suggests `nums.length ^ nums[i] ^ i`

#### React

- Redux using analogy of insurance company. Redux consist of
  - Action Creator
  - Action
  - dispatch
  - Reducers
  - State
- In the analogy, Person drops of a `form (Action)` stating policy or claim and front desk of insurance company, `form receiver (dispatch)` hand over the form to `insurance departments` consisting of accounting, policies and claim history `(Reducers)`. Finally all processed policy or claim comes in form of `compiled department data (State)`
