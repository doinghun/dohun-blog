JavaScript

- New Syntax
  - object `delete`: can delete a key value pair
  - `extends`: class x (child) extends y (parent)

React & Node

- Sending API request from port 4000 (Client) to port 3000 (Server)
- Since they are running on different ports, they are different JavaScript origin. It doesn't matter that they are on the same machine/hostname.
- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  - Same-Origin Policy : a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one `origin` can interact with a resource from another `origin`
  - CORS introduces a standard mechanism that can be used by all browsers for implementing cross-domain requests.
    The spec defines a set of headers that allow the browser and server to communicate about which requests are (and are not) allowed.
  ```javascript
  app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD"); // update to match the domain you will make the request from
    res.header(
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
      "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept"
    );
    next();
  });
  ```
